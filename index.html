                <p>While you may have high-traffic keywords in your list if they don’t lead to conversions that’s a serious problem. Google Analytics is a great way to determine how visitors are finding websites and which sources are converting into sales or other significant results.</p>
                <p>If you’re having trouble with any of your lead sources, Google AdWords pay-per-click advertising can be an effective option. You’ll need a targeted list of keywords and suggestions from the professionals at Yodle, but creating ads for PPC can send highly qualified prospects directly to your site when their search terms match what you’ve bought from Google.</p>
                <p>Paid advertising lets you show up above the organic search results page, so people who will likely be interested in your product or service see you right away. You can even target people in certain locations or with certain interests who are more likely to convert.</p>
                <p>Although Google’s tools are free, Yodle has extensive experience working with local businesses and digital marketing. They’re an excellent option for anyone struggling with their lead sources because of the wealth of knowledge they’ve gathered about advertising on <a href="https://purposemind.com/google-my-business/">Google My Business</a>.</p>
                <p>For any business looking to get new customers by using their services, Yodle is a great choice thanks to their strong track record of helping local companies reach more potential customers through PPC ads and Google Places listing management.</p>

                    <p>Google My Business is a Google tool that can help your business be more visible on Google Search and Maps, as well as across Google’s network of partner sites like Gmail and YouTube.</p>
                    <p>When you sign in to your Google account, go to “Your Business” (above) to start managing your location on Google. You can update your business information for free, upload photos and videos, share posts from other places where you <a href="https://purposemind.com/content-optimization/">manage content</a> (like Facebook or Instagram), open individual customer reviews in a lightbox, etc. The data below covers how many businesses have taken advantage of this opportunity over the last few years:</p>
                    <p>From January 2017 to November 2017 alone an additional 36 million+ local businesses were added to the Google My Business network, bringing the total number of Google My Business listings to over 100 million in 2017.</p>

            <h2 style="color:#007b2b">FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR LEADS PROMPTLY.</h2>
            <p>You probably think this goes without saying, but you would be surprised at how many business owners don’t do it.  If the reason they contacted your company is because of something that’s time-sensitive (such as an upcoming event), make sure to follow up with them promptly.</p>
            <p>Don’t lead people on when they are trying to visit your website.</p>
            <p>People are more likely to complete an action if they believe it will yield positive results for them. You can increase the likelihood of your customers completing actions on your site by using clear and concise language and telling them exactly what steps need to be taken next.</p>
            <p>Build credibility and trust with Google my Business listings.</p>
            <p>It may seem counterintuitive, but people tend to be more comfortable with brands that they trust. One way to build trust is by showing reviews for your company. Google has begun to penalize companies with negative reviews, so focus on soliciting reviews from happy customers (ideally ones who are outside of your normal social circle) and make sure those reviews are positive.</p>
            <p>Be willing to go above and beyond for customer service.</p>
            <p>People will use every resource at their disposal today before making a purchase decision online. If you can provide excellent help when they’re researching your product or service, then it’s much more likely that you’ll earn their business moving forward. You can take things one step further by providing exceptional post-purchase support as well since this demonstrates how committed you are to caring for your customers.</p>
            <p>Add Google My Business to your website.</p>
            <p>Having a Google my Business listing is vital if you want to rank in local search and it’s beneficial for increasing brand awareness and driving traffic to your site. Adding a link directly on your website that directs people to the Google my Business listings on Google can help increase the amount of times visitors complete this crucial step in the buying process.</p>
            <p>If you have been using Google My Business, you may wonder how many times should I refresh my information? Or whether refreshing will overwrite what I have done on GMB previously? Some steps need to follow when updating business information with GMB:</p>
            <br>
            <ol style="padding-left: 50px;">
                <li>Please do not refresh your business information more than 2 times a day.</li><br>
                <li>Please make sure to add new information rather than overwrite old content when possible.</li><br>
                <li>Please do not add more than one GMB account under the same specific email, you may create a new GMB account with a different email to manage them separately.</li><br>
                <li>No matter how many listings you have on Google my Business, please update your business information only once per day or multiple updates will be rejected by the Google server after 3rd attempt (don’t worry all the updated info will remain on Google).</li><br>
                <li>Before refreshing please back up any changes made (we recommend keeping a copy of all your original data before making any changes to it), like keywords, descriptions, photos, etc., you can use a Google Sheet to record your business information and publish it again if something went wrong.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>GM will reject any repeated updates within 1 day or 3rd attempt, so please only update once per day. If you need to make more changes, please wait at least 24 hours before repeating the process.  If you forgot to back up your original data first and made some serious errors, we also recommend waiting at least 2 days(48 hours) before refreshing your business data since it could take several days for other users to see those updates on their search results. You may experience slow updates but all the changes will remain on Google Database as long as you don’t delete them.</p>
            <p>If you’re still unsure about what to do, we recommend waiting at least 24 hours before updating your GMB data. Once that’s done, it’ll take Google another seven days (sometimes less) to show updates in search results. You should also be aware that while the process is automatic, there may be a delay between when Google receives your update and when it gets processed.</p>
            <p>This simplified guideline will help save a lot of time and provide you with a better understanding of how Google My Business data refresh works.</p>

            <h2 style="color:#007b2b">CONVERT AS MANY LEADS AS POSSIBLE INTO PAYING CUSTOMERS.</h2>
            <p>If you’re a small business owner, there’s a good chance your best source of new customers is going to come from online search. Whether it’s Google or Facebook paid to advertise, running an ad campaign can easily pay for itself if the campaign converts well. Here are some tips to help increase conversions and get more out of your next online marketing campaign!</p>
            <p>Conversion rate refers to the percentage of website visitors who take action. A high conversion rate means that when someone comes to your site, they’re engaging and interested in what you have to offer versus leaving and never coming back. The higher your conversion rate, the better because it means you’ll be spending less on ads but still bringing in plenty of revenue! So let’s look at 5 strategies to improve your site’s conversion rate, starting with how Google my Business can help.</p>
            <p>Google My Business is free to use for businesses of all sizes and gives you the ability to set up a website, edit business information, respond to reviews, optimize your listing with photos and videos, and connect with local customers in more than 60 countries! When it comes to likes and reviews for our Google my Business page we always ask that when possible leave one if we have helped you in some way, we will do whatever we can do to provide quality service. A high number of customer reviews can dramatically influence whether or not someone clicks through your ad to visit your site.</p>
            <p>Google My Business helps leads find you when they’re searching online. The best practice for increasing conversions from both paid and organic search campaigns is to be where people are already looking for you, so any time spent on an offline campaign should be well thought out before spending money.</p>
            <p>Google my Business offers two main types of ads: call extensions (when someone calls you directly through your ad) and location extensions (when someone searches near your business). One advantage that Google my Business has over other <a href="https://purposemind.com/search-engine-optimization/">search engines</a> is that you can add multiple campaigns to the same ad group, making it easy to compare and see which ads are most effective. Location extensions allow you to display your address and phone number when someone is searching within a specific radius of your business location. This makes it even easier for people to find you while narrowing down their search results.</p>
            <p>Google my Business also offers options for customizing the look of ads including using your logo, images, or videos providing examples of how happy customers are with what you offer, but remember quality over quantity since Google will penalize low-quality content so make sure whatever you submit it’s something that will have a big impact on conversions. Google My Business also allows you to build brand awareness through social media integration, Google+ reviews, and the ability to add links back to your website or blog. This extension gives any business a chance to gain even more exposure in their local area.</p>
            <p>A common mistake is thinking that a low click-through rate is a bad sign when in fact it can signify a good thing! If you have a strong ad with lots of information then people might need multiple exposures before they’re ready to visit your site or call for more information.</p>
